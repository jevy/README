# Jevin's README for colleagues

I used to be a big fan of READMEs. The idea sounds great: make a doc so other people can understand you and work with you the way you want.

I've grown to find that this isn't true. My README is very much an idealized and biased view of myself so take this all with a grain of salt.

The "Random things about me" below is the only thing you can really trust. :D :D

## A few random things about me

* I'm born on Christmas day.
* I have 3 kids and I'm married to a lovely gal (Ashley)
* I regularly host [House Concerts for the neighbourhood (video)](https://fb.watch/3KekGIjEpU/) (pre-Covid)
* I've been PC gaming since I was 7 (32 years!).
* I have developed moderate anxiety since 2016. It is mostly activated when I feel a sense of loss of control.
* I discovered in Sept 2021 that I also have ADHD which was the root of my anxiety this whole time. My medication has been life changing
* Urban biking is one of my favourite pass times.
* I've been consulting since 2010 with some stints in early startups (employee or cofounder).
* I'm allergic to pretty much all animals and the entire outdoors.
* I really enjoy [amateur radio](https://www.qrz.com/db/VA3JEV) and I'm now talking to people around the world with Morse code.
* I'm pretty geeky: I run Linux NixOS on my personal machine and have a Kubernetes Homelab with 7 PIs and 1 PC. 


## Overall Themes

* Strong relationships can carry me through anything. I invest heavily into them since these seem to outlast most companies.
* Creating less stress. Candor, end to end tests, planning these all create situations of lowering stress. I don't like stress and I think most people don't? So ya know, how can we reduce stress?

## How I approach work

**Results focused** - I don't really care when or how people work. The most important thing is that the right work is getting done. I've worked remotely with teams all over the world and for the most part, it has worked out super well. To do this we need to be organized, have excellent lines of communications where everyone can work asynchronously.

**Work/Life Balance** - Working too much makes you less productive. [ This is a great article ](https://getlighthouse.com/blog/work-life-balance-hustle-hype/) that really resonates with me (studies included). 

**Working smart.. and hard** - It's easy to stay busy and grind out work. Taking a step back and think about what can be done to work smarter can sometimes go REALLY far. For example: Instead of labeling 1000s of images yourself, hiring people on Mechanical Turk is an excellent use of time and money. I'm committed to prioritizing and cutting scope ruthlessly to keep us sustainable.

**Keep on Shipping** - I generally think that  putting something in the wild and measuring the results will almost always be better than over planning. We should always be asking the question: "Is this good enough for now?"

## Things that take my energy away

* **When I feel like I'm not making an impact** drains my energy like nothing else. I'm always hunting to figure out how to make the best use of my time.

* **Not having a plan** - When I don't know where I am and where I'm going, I get stressed. Having a clear plan on steps to move forward, no matter how abstract bring me focus.

## What energizes me

* I really love positive and negative feedback. As a data person, it's really one of the best ways to know how I'm doing as a manager and employee. Give me as much feedback as you can.

* Getting everyone on the same page.

* Having a plan to get unstuck.

* Building clear stated expectations of me from both by direct reports and my supervisor.

* Metrics so we know how to improve.

* Creative solutions to solve problems.

* Making something manual and laborious into a system and a process.

## One one Ones (1o1s)

I started doing 1o1s in 2016, and I saw how incredibly powerful they were.

If you're a manager and you're not sure about 1o1s and think they are a waste of time, [the research shows they have incredible ROI](https://www.slideshare.net/evanish/everything-you-need-to-know-about-1-on-1s-to-prevent-turnover-and-motivate-your-team).

If you're a manager or employee I'll be overseeing, [please read this article, even if you've done 1o1s before](https://getlighthouse.com/blog/one-on-ones-employee-know/)

* They are for you to grow
* 1o1s are not for status updates or organizing work unless you want to talk about those
* I would like to start with high frequency.

## Candor

* You are welcome to ask me whatever you want. I'll let you know if it's not something I'm comfortable talking about and why.
* In general, I default towards transparency, but sometimes there are things that I'm not able to share.
* Integrity is important to me both personally and professionally. While there may be things I'm mistaken about or can't share I will do my utmost to present to you truth as I know it.
